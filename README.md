![Zoe Demo](https://i.imgur.com/xlodADb.gif)

## Zoe 
Zoe is a minimalistic AI agent framework that's simple and easy to run, optimized for onboarding people into agent tech, it offers both assistant and autonomous modes, can be consumed via CLI, telegram bot, or Web CHAT. It uses both vercel AI SDK and atoma network to execute LLM calls. It can be extended with new tools and ecosystem integrations having already direct access to most of the sui ecosystem via the sui-agent-tools package.

### üåü Key Features

- **üí¨ Assistant Mode**: Chat naturally with Zoe to execute DeFi operations
  ```bash
  You: "Swap 10 SUI for USDC"
  Zoe: "I'll help you swap 10 SUI for USDC using the best available rate..."
  ```
- **ü§ñ Autonomous Mode**: Set up automated trading and monitoring
  ```bash
  You: "Monitor USDC/SUI price and swap when it hits 10"
  Zoe: "I'll watch the USDC/SUI pair and execute the swap when target is reached..."
  ```




## Sui Agent Tools Overview
Sui Agent Tools provides a comprehensive suite of blockchain tools with unmatched ecosystem coverage - from DEX integrations to lending protocols. The entire Sui agent ecosystem can leverage these tools since they are built to be fully compatible with atoma-agents, sui-agent-kit, eliza, Open AI, and vercel AI SDK. This means any agent in the ecosystem can tap into it. While these powerful tools come pre-integrated into Zoe's natural language interface, they can be easily plugged into any agent.
